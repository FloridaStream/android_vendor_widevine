Description:
Google's framework for writing and using C++ mock classes on a variety of
platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, Symbian, etc). Inspired by
jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with C++'s specifics in mind, it can
help you derive better designs of your system and write better tests.

While gMock supports building with the Android NDK out-of-the-box, it needs some
small modifications to build as part of the Android OS build.  Specifically, it
needs a different format of build script, and it needs to build against the OS'
modified version of gTest, rather than the packaged version.
